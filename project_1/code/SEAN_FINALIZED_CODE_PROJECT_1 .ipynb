    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "- The SAT, which is administered by the College board, is a standardized test that is used for college admissions in the U.S. As the board of directors on the Educational Testing Services under the College Board, we assert that participation in SAT test may likely translate to fair evaluations on students' readiness for college/career, increase their chances of gaining admission to good schools and subsequent upward social mobility in the long-term. We are especially concerned with low SAT participation rates amongst students from poorer socio-economic counties in California, U.S, and would like to propose best practices to improve SAT participation amongst students from low socio-economic counties. \n",

    "- Multiple sources have pointed out that participation rates in SAT appear to be influenced heavily by factors, especially socioeconomic status and income levels. For example, economically disadvantaged students are discouraged from participating in SAT due to reasons such as having difficulty paying for SAT fees, or financial challenges in bearing future university tuition fees. Such reasons may discourage young people from poorer backgrounds from taking the first step in taking the SATs.\n",

    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."

    "*We would like to make various recommendations based on our findings above.*\n",
    "\n",
    "`Recommendation 1`: \n",
    "- `Increase access to SAT participation by removing financial barriers` Given that the ability to pay for SAT fees might likely be a barrier to SAT participation, we propose offering SAT free of charge for all grade 11 students to ensure universal SAT participation. This would also boost their confidence in the event they wish to re-attempt SAT in grade 12. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Recommendation 2`: \n",
    "- `Offer SAT during regular school hours` SAT are conducted mostly on Saturdays, which may likely deter low-income individuals from participating in SAT since they are more likely to have part-time jobs, family responsibilities, etc. We propose offering SAT to be conducted during regular school hours to increase their access to SAT participation. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Recommendation 3`: \n",
    "- `Offer free access to extra learning materials` Students from lower-income counties, unlike their richer counterparts, may likely have less access to additional learning materials such as SAT online courses and prep classes. Consequently, these students may become less motivated to participate in SAT. We propose offering free access to these learning materials to low-income students to increase their motivation and readiness to take SAT. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Recommendation 4`: \n",
    "- `Create a college-going culture` Students from lower-income counties are more likely than their higher-income counterparts to have social and language barriers, less access to information on college, less exploration because of low expectations and underestimation of the amount of financial help available in college. These factors may possibly deter participation in SAT. We propose 1) training to school staff on how to begin promoting high standards and expectations for students and families to achieve at a higher level, as well as 2) academic planning for college and career readiness and college, career exploration and selection processes. \n",
