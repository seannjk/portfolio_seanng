# Using NLP to detect COVID-19 anti-vaccine tweets on Twitter

### Introduction & Problem Statement  
- The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines provided a glimmer of hope and a pathway to recovery. However, owing to misinformation being spread on social media and other platforms, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy which can lead to a negative impact on vaccine uptake in the population.

The World Health Organization said anti-vaccine views were a "top 10 global health threat" in 2019.

- Twitter has employed us with the goal of
  - A) Evaluating the performance of different natural language processing models to identify anti-vaccination tweets that were published during the COVID-19 pandemic
  - B)  Deriving a minimum viable product by use of the most effective machine learning model to create a preliminary vaccine misinformation detection framework
